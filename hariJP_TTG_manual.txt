For Linux and Mac users :  TTG.jar
You will need to install java runtime environment (JRE) first.
This is the rewritten orginal windows application in Java for Linux and Mac users. 

For windows users.
TTG.jar will work on windows too, but native windows application is also given.
Run  the  standard  setup program -  College Time Table Setup 2.2 (For Windows).exe
This will create the desktop shortcut with icon. This is stand alone setup pack.
You will not need JRE or any other package for this executable.
The look and feel of windows application will be different but both have almost same features. 

Thanks
